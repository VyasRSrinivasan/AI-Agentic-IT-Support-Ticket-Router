# Schemas Architecture Details

## Design Philosophy

The system is designed as a decision pipeline, NOT a chatbot.
Agents come up with structured outputs and the workflow/verifier gives constraints as to what actions are acceptable.

## Pipeline

### 1. Ticket 
(_ticket.py_)

- Normalized representation of an incoming support request

### 2. DetectorOutput 
(_detector.py_)

- Early safety/completeness signals

### 3. TriageOutput 
(_triage.py_)

- Classification along multiple axes

### 4. EvidenceBundle 
(_evidence.py_)

- Structured container for retrieved grounding evidence.
- Holds lists of `EvidenceChunk` items 

### 5. ResolutionDraft 
(_resolution.py_)

- Proposed automated response generated by the resolver

### 6. VerificationResult 
(_verifier.py_)

- Safety gate for automation

### 7. Decision 
(_decision.py_)

- Final operational action
